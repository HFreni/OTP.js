# OTP.js
OTP.js is a node.js library for interfacing with Object Transform Protocol (ESTA E1.59). This is an open source library, developed by [Infinitus Lux, LLC](https://www.infinituslux.com/), in order to allow javascript projects, such as our internal tooling, to use OTP.

OTP.js is licensed under the MIT license, this means that you are free to do with it as you please. I'd love to see what kind of cool stuff folks come up with.
